You might intrigued by the existence of two seperate URL modules in Python
-- urllib and urllib2
Even more intrigung: they are not alternative for each other.
So what is the difference between urllib and urllib2, 
and do we need them both?

urllib and urllib2 are both Python modules that do URL request related stuff
but offer different functionalities. Their wto most significant differences
are listed below

''' urllib2 can accepts a Request object to set the headers for a URL request,
while urllib can only accepts a URL. That means, you can not masquerade your
User Agent string, etc in urllib.
